In this work we examined the effect of anthropogenic disturbance at the landscape level on neutral genetic diversity and diversity at the important immune gene region of the 
Major Histocompatibility Complex class II and multiple pathogen infections in a common neotropical rodent generalist, the Tomey's spiny rat (_Proechimys semispinosus_).

The folder arlequin contains the data input file for the arlequin analysis.

The folder circos contains all necessary layers to produce figure 2 of the main manuscript using the circos software.

The file PrseDRB.fasta contains all Proechimys semispinosus MHC DRB exon 2 sequences with corresponding names that we obtained from sequencing.

The files prse_meta_full.csv and SEM_dataset.csv contain meta information about the sampled individuals and were used to run the analyses in R.

The file publication_code.R file contains all code for running the analyses performed in R.
