"Hidden zoonotic risk: immunogenetic-pathogen networks shrink in a generalist rodent inhabiting disturbed landscapes"

by Ramona Fleischer, Georg Joachim Eibner, Nina Isabell Schwensow, Sofia Paraskevopoulou, Gerd Mayer, Victor Max Corman, Christian Drosten, Kerstin Wilhelm,

In this work we investigate the effect of anthropogenic disturbance at the landscape level on genetic diversity at the important immune gene region of the 
Major Histocompatibility Complex class II and pathogen infections in a common neotropical rodent generalist, the spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus).
