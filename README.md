In this work we examined the effect of anthropogenic disturbance at the landscape level on neutral genetic diversity and diversity at the important immune gene region of the 
Major Histocompatibility Complex class II and multiple pathogen infections in a common neotropical rodent generalist, the Tomey's spiny rat (_Proechimys semispinosus_).
